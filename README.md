# DumbPhone-Project
This is a project I created in December of 2024. When run in the IOS app "scriptable" the user is able to create a widget that will open apps from a list when prompted. This is similar to many paid widget apps on IOS that offer this same function - this, however, is free. One limitation of the design is that the scriptable app lacks system-level privileges. The best fix (included) is to run a shortcut to open an app instead of running the universal link.
